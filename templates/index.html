            <p id = "intro">This webpage was created in an attempt to utlize Machine Learning in the world of sports, specifically the National Basketball Association.</p>
            <p id = "p1">The world of sports is continually evolving with the integration of science for the optimization of its athletes, especially when concerned with their health and their ability to maintain their longevity. The world of Data Science has also crept its way into how the game is coached and susbsequently, how the game is played. It is now commonplace for star athletes to be rested for "meaningless" games in order to survive the grueling marathon that is the NBA Regular Season.</p>
